# Django_Projects

Here are uploaded my web-apps, created with framework Django.

The main web-app is "natalia_toys". This is an online store for the sale of handmade plush toys. This application 
implements a catalog and search through it, user verification via e-mail, user profile. Also created a system of orders 
and their history, which the user can see (only their orders). Payment for orders was made using the Yukassa payment 
terminal. For more information, please read the documentation inside the application. For the correct work of the
application, it is necessary to install all the requirements, which are indicated in the file with the corresponding 
name.
